# Refactoring Test

## A challenge for front-end developers

While this app does technically work the code quality is poor. That's where you come in!

For this test you will be updating the code to be more manageable and adhere more to modern best practices for React apps.

We are specifically looking for code structure/component composition, accurate typings, as well as converting class-based components to a more functional approach.

## Submitting your solution

Clone this repository and set up your own, new repository as the origin remote. 

Once your remote repository is ready, add @ckortekaas and @nathanhoad and let us know that you've completed the challenge.
